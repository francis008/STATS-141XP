## In Brief:

**>   Students taking all courses online tend to have fewer total courses and are less likely to be in-state.**

**>   The number of courses taken and residency status are modestly associated with online enrollment patterns.**

**>   Arts courses are popular but less likely to be taken fully online.**



```{r}
data <- data %>% # data prep
  mutate(
    total_courses = lower_division_course_ct + arts_ct + engineering_ct + humanities_ugeduc_ct +
                    life_sci_ct + phys_sci_ct + soc_sci_intl_inst_ct + mgmt_ct + other_prof_ct,
    only_online = if_else(online_course_ct == total_courses & total_courses > 0, 1, 0)
  )

# Logistic Regression -- predicting taking only online courses
model1 <- glm(
  only_online ~ californian + lower_division_course_ct + arts_ct + engineering_ct + humanities_ugeduc_ct +
                life_sci_ct + phys_sci_ct + soc_sci_intl_inst_ct + mgmt_ct + other_prof_ct,
  family = binomial(),
  data = data
)

summary(model1)
```

## Findings:

**Out-of-state students are significantly more likely to take only online courses.**

**Taking more arts, physical science, or social science courses is associated with lower odds of being exclusively online.**

**Some variables are not useful here due to data issues (large SEs).**
